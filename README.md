Jupyter Notebook (Octave Kernel) alternatives for Numerical Methods laboratories @ UPB

## Introduction

Why [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)?
As they say on their official website, it allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
It's easier to organize tutorials and laboratories into notebooks which can be easily modified by students and verified by assistants.
